Hi, Iâ€™m Sama ðŸ‘‹

I build AI-powered and robotics-based projects that combine innovation, clarity, and purpose.

Role: Computer Vision & C++ Developer (Student Researcher)

Tech: Python, C++, Arduino, TensorFlow, OpenCV, YOLO, ,

Interests: Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Robotics, Aerospace Engineering, Automation, and Computer Vision

ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects:

Blinky Blanket â€” Designed a computer visionâ€“based smart blanket that uses AI detection and camera-based monitoring to automatically adjust its position, reducing infantsâ€™ suffocation risk without external intervention.

DeCrowd â€” Developed an ICT-based smart traffic management system using sensors, AI, and IoT to reduce congestion and air pollution. Trained a deep learning model using advanced computer vision algorithms to accurately detect and predict crowd density in real time, enabling dynamic traffic control and optimized emergency lane management.

PWR Loop â€” Developed a closed water system that purifies and recycles water for continuous reuse, promoting sustainability and resource conservation.

Green Torque â€” Designed a system to harness kinetic energy from studentsâ€™ movement through doors, converting it into usable stored energy.

Ashurifier â€” Designed a closed system that purifies air from harmful gases using chemical filtration.
